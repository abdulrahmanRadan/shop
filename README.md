## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- PHP (version 7.0 or higher)
- MySQL or MariaDB
- Web server (such as Apache or Nginx)
- XAMPP or a similar PHP development environment (if running on Windows)

## Database
you needs to import the database file using XAMPP. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

Start XAMPP and ensure that the MySQL service is running. You can do this by opening XAMPP and checking that "MySQL" has a checkmark next to it in the menu.
Open a web browser and type "localhost/phpmyadmin" in the address bar.
You will be redirected to the phpMyAdmin interface.
Create a new database by clicking the "New" button in the left sidebar.
Give the database a name of your choice for your project (e.g., "shop_db") and select the required character encoding, then click the "Create" button.
Once the database is created, go to the "Import" tab at the top of the page.
Click on the "Choose File" button and select the database file from the project (e.g., "shop_db.sql").
Leave the other options as they are and click the "Go" button at the bottom of the page.
phpMyAdmin will read the database file and import it into the database you created.
Once the import is complete, a confirmation message will appear indicating the success of the operation.
With this, you will have a ready-to-use database for your "Shop with MVC PHP" project. Please make sure to update the database connection information in the necessary project files to ensure proper communication with the database.
